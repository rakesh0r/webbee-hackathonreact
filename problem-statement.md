Grading
We will grade your project by 5 attributes, each on a scale of 1-10. If an attribute dips below 7 it disqualifies your solution. For every bonus task done well we will add 0,5 points. You need an average score of at least 8 to pass this round.

Feature completeness 1-10
User friendliness 1-10
No edge cases & bug free 1-10
Code style & architecture 1-10
Hints
4/10 people fail on feature completeness because they did not read the project description carefully or asked questions. Our tip: Read carefully, check if your project fullfills every user story and ask if you dont understand something 100 %. You can even ask questions during implementing the project - we are here to help!
5/10 people fail because their code is buggy and they have not tested it properly for edge cases. If you test < 2 hours the chance is high, you belong to this category. Our tip: test your stuff!
